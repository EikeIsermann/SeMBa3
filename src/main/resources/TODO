- Build ScalaTest and thorughly test collection handling

- Switch to TDB or single file library. Might enhance performance but increases effort for item removal and single item
operations.

- Add functionality for file versioning

- Look into simple text search. Should have very low performance at the moment?

- Improve metadata. Add XML Configuration for extracted metadata. Add labels to metadata. Put analysis in jobactor.

- Look into additional Thumbnail generators.

- Add singleton actor for checking path availability (even with concurrent list there are duplicate files at the moment)
